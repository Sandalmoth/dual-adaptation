    "## OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "The project contains several simulators that were used for different parts of the paper. Essentially we have\n",
    "\n",
    "__Deterministic simulator__\n",
    "\n",
    "- `simtools.py` The numeric solver for the PDE that describes the evolution of the secondary resistance mechanisms over time.\n",
    "- `abc.py` The approximate bayesian computation parameter fitting system, that, given some observation of gain and loss of a possible resistance mechanism parameter finds the probable cell growth rate as a function of that parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Stochastic simulators__\n",
    "These take .hdf5 input files containing the adaptation parameter probability density function, and a parametrized rate function + some other simulation settings from `simulation-config.toml`. For the `statics-mpi` the probability density functions are just the initial conditions, but for `dap-mpi` and `holiday-mpi` the input has one or more time series of PDFs as calculated by the PDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dap-mpi` An implementation of Gillespie's algorithm simulating the growth of cells with the continuous secondary resistance mechanism. Can optionally use a time-varying death rate.\n",
    "- `holiday-mpi` Same as above, but takes an entire set of PDE backgrounds, each for a different drug holiday.\n",
    "- `statics-mpi` Constrained population size stochastic simulation variants. Specifically to test whether the ABC inferred parameters produce the same results (in terms of resistance parameter adaptation) in a fully simulated context as in the PDE approximation (S1 Fig).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above need to be ran in an MPI context (e.g. `mpirun -n ... ./code/bin/dap-mpi ...`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementations above are all relatively specialized for the investigations in the associated paper. However, the individual classes in `dual_adaptation_process.h`, `dynamic_dap.h`, `logistic_dap.h` and `static_dap.h` could be reused in a more general context with relative ease."

    "## USE\n",
    "\n",
    "As the tools share a lot of inputs and outputs, they have been tied together in a toolchain using Snakemake. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the workflows start by fitting some rate function parameters to a set of observations of some hypothetical resistance mechanism. The resulting data is either directly visualized, or fed into more advanced simulators for further analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Snakemake workflows exist for the following files. (Note, the `up` and `down` is replaced with the name of the tables of observations)\n",
    "\n",
    "`results/figures/up.down.abc-diagnostic.pdf`  \n",
    "`results/figures/up.down.abc-fit.pdf`  \n",
    "These generate plots showing diagnostic output from the ABC fitting, and some plots showing the fitted result (Fig 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "`results/figures/up.down.verify.logistic.pdf`  \n",
    "`results/figures/up.down.verify.static.pdf`  \n",
    "These workflows compare the PDE output to the results of a proper stochastic simulation of cells with a continuous resistance mechanism as described in the paper (S1 Fig)\n",
    "\n",
    "`results/figures/up.down.mpi.pdf`  \n",
    "This workflow estimates the risk of mutation by running a large number of stochastic simulations. Due to the high computational cost, this probably needs to be run on an HPC cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "`results/figures/up.down.holiday-processed.pdf`  \n",
    "`results/figures/up.down.holiday-input.pdf`  \n",
    "`results/figures/up.down.holiday.pdf`  \n",
    "These workflows estimate the risk of mutation for different drug-holiday scenarios. As above, the high comuptational cost mean they likely need to run on an HPC cluster. All three rely on the same simulation output however, so the simulation only needs to run once (Fig 6, 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate new scenarios outside of those examined in the paper, one needs to provide new observation files, and to update the `simulation-config`\n",
    "Let's start by inspecting the observation input files:"

The `.csv` files should be placed in `data/raw_internal` like the provided files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The settings need to be adjusted to work for that input. In particular:\n",
    "- update `time_range_*` to match the new observations\n",
    "- update `parameter_range`, `optimum_normal` and `optimum_treatment` to match the low and high observations.\n",

    "snakemake results/figures/[up].[down].abc-diagnostic.pdf\n",
    "snakemake results/figures/[up].[down].abc-fit.pdf\n",

    "to fit the rate function parameters to the observations, and optionally\n",

    "to verify that the fit holds up in a detailed simulation, is possible.\n",
    "`[up]` and `[down]` should be replaced with the name of the up and down observation file (sans .csv) that are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "After verifying that the results look good (e.g. check the abc-diagnostic for convergence and lack of clipping for any parameter, check verify that proper simulation agrees with approximations) one may proceed to estimating the risk of resistance mutation. If abc hasn't converged, or there is clipping, try adjusting the corresponding parameters and rerunning the above commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimating the risk of mutation as a function of time likely doesn't need any further adjustments to the settings file. We can simply run\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "snakemake results/figures/[up].[down].mpi.pdf\n",
    "```\n",
    "and though it can run on a regular computer, it may be necessary to use some larger (MPI capable) cluster in the interest of time. Some clusters may struggle with rendering graphics for the pdf. `rule mpi` (see the Snakefile) is the computationally heavy step, so, a workaround is to run the steps leading up to that command locally, run that on a cluster, and then run the last step locally again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of running the workflow in an HPC context is going to vary between different clusters, so cannot easily be described here. However, the most flexible way is very likely to write a script that runs the command in the `rule mpi` rule and to specifically copy those input files to the cluster, rather than to rely on it to support snakemake. But as stated, it will depend, and if running on some larger workstation/server rather than a shared cluster then snakemake is more likely the easier option.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the drug holiday simulations, first adjust `holiday_start_range` and `holiday_duration_range` to some values that seem reasonable in light of the resistance adaptation curves in `*.abc-fit.pdf`. Try to effectively cover the range where adaptation is happening, as outside of that the results are going to be constant. The other parameters can be left as-is. To generate all the results run:\n",
